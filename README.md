# TETRIS

The timeless classic, with some quirky new pieces.

## Getting Started

After downloading or cloning this repository, open the 'index.html' file in your browser. The game should start automatically. Gameplay uses the the 4 directional keys. Up-Key will rotate the active piece counter-clockwise. Left and Right keys will shift the piece one step in either direction. Lastly the Down-Key will commit and drop the piece down.

## Prerequisites

The latest Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

## Goals

   * Create levels based on score (100 pts).
   * For each level speed raises by 50 (milliseconds).
   * Game background changes color with each level. 
   * Line sweep (arenaSweep) highlights the completed line before removing it. 
   * Include a timer. 
   * Add a border to each piece. 
   * Introduce harder pieces in harder levels.
   * If down key is pressed once the piece should be lowered a bit faster than standard speed.
   * If down key is double tapped, piece drops all the way and commits to its location.
   * Include a "Next Piece" display on the screen.
